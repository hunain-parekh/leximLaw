                            <p>"At Lexom Law, we understand the importance of the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program and the opportunities it provides for eligible individuals who were brought to the United States as children. Our dedicated team of immigration attorneys specializes in DACA law and is committed to helping eligible individuals navigate the DACA process to obtain protection from deportation and work authorization.</p>
                            <p>DACA is a program that offers temporary relief from deportation and provides eligible individuals, often referred to as Dreamers, with work authorization. It allows young people who meet specific criteria to remain in the United States, pursue education, and contribute to their communities without the constant fear of removal.</p>
                            <p>Our firm have a deep understanding of the DACA program, and the requirements involved. We are dedicated to guiding you through the DACA application process, ensuring that your rights are protected, and advocating for your case with expertise and compassion.</p>

                            <p>Eligibility Evaluation: We will assess your eligibility for the DACA program based on the specific criteria set by U.S. immigration laws.

We will provide a thorough evaluation to determine if you meet the DACA eligibility requirements.</p>
                            <p>Application Preparation: Our attorneys will assist you in gathering the necessary documents and information to support your DACA application. We will help you complete the required forms accurately and ensure that all supporting evidence is properly compiled and submitted.</p>
                            <p>Submission and Follow-Up: We will submit your DACA application on your behalf to the appropriate U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) office. Our team will closely monitor the progress of your application, respond to any requests for additional information, and ensure that your case moves forward smoothly and efficiently.</p>
                            <p>Renewals and Updates: If you are already a DACA recipient, we can assist you with the renewal process to ensure that your protection and work authorization remain valid. Additionally, we can help you with any updates or changes to your DACA status, such as updating your address or obtaining a new employment authorization document (EAD).</p>
                            <p>Ongoing Support: Our dedicated team will provide ongoing support throughout your DACA journey. We will address any questions or concerns you may have, keep you informed about the latest developments, and provide guidance on maintaining your DACA status.</p>
                            <p>At Lexom Law, we understand the importance of the DACA program in providing relief and opportunities for Dreamers. Our experienced attorneys are committed to helping eligible individuals navigate the DACA process and secure the protection and work authorization they deserve.</p>
